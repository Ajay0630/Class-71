                    Review:
                    We are having a wonderful time in the resort.
                    All the staff members are very hospitable, courteous & always ready to help.
                    The rooms are quite spacious with a jacuzzi 😊!What more does one need to have fun!!! Unlimited food & drinks, hungry at 2 am there is 24 hour coffee & snacks available.
                    Definitely a second vacation soon over here.

                    Disney Land is a theme park that has epic rides! You can go on huge trampolines and rollercoasters. You may also get wet in some of the rides! Here is a review for Disneyland:
                    Review: Believe it or not, Walt Disney is a great place to experience ever.
                    I am visiting from Saudi Arabia and my impression of the Walt Disney parks are wonderful. My family had a great time. It was a great time and great resort for the price. There is so many things to do for the whole family day and night. Walt Disney use activities that make learning engaging and fun, my family are more willing to participate and take risks, having fun while learning helps us retain information better because the process is enjoyable and memorable.
                    Lots of parks within a park. The experience is just amazing! It’s great for all ages. I have three children and we love coming here as often as possible. Walt Disney was fun to visit.
                    Defiantly highly recommended it.

                <p>Thoroughly wrapped up with incredible action, excitement, WOW’moments and humor — Avengers: Endgame delivers on it's promise by providing a truly epic conclusion (in the grandest fashion possible!) to 11 years of Marvel Cinematic Universe awesomeness. This one, indeed felt like an emotional roller-coaster ride, and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved. The Russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really, really high with their final installment. Despite the longsome 3hr length, the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that it's quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second. This is probably one of the most emotional films I've ever come across (surprisingly!), with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close. Endgame faithfully shines in every department, while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale.

                    I feel that both 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame' are must-see events for every movie-goers, whether or not they've seen a Marvel film before. A round of applause for the film makers, cast & crew, all the backroom staff and anyone else who've helped to curate this masterpiece. Screw piracy, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed in a theatre, and trust me - it's worth every single penny!</p>

                <p>What makes a remake film that too an animated film very successful and chart buster?
                    The answer is available in Lion King.
                    Disney's Lion King is the result of modern techniques in film making, combining VR with Photorealistic Computer graphics to give a real life feeling. A common man will not find it as a cartoon character but view it as real story of animals and birds living in jungle scenario.
                    Jon Favreau and his team bring into life the tale of Simba, the Cub, his father Mufasa, his mother, scheming evil uncle Scar, Simba's best friend Nala very beautifully and enjoyably too.
                    The theatre audience roars along with the characters when they sing, dance and laugh with every feeling and virtually travel with them. The dialogues are simple and songs are lovely. " Circle of Life" as explained by Mufasa to Simba, "Hakuna matata" ('no worries' in Swahili) will be remembered for a long time by the children who watch the film. The voice for the characters are given by famous people like Donald Glover, Beyonce Knowles Carter, James Earl Jones and others. Photography, Special effects and music are brilliant.
                    The songs, "Spirit", "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", "He Lives in You" and more songs are echoing in the theatre.
                    The story is simple and not given by me as spoiler except to state how a scheming uncle kills his brother, drives out young cub who later realises his responsibilities return back to claim his rightful position.
                    Nothing to stop you from enjoying the film with family in 3D environment and theatrical surround sound.
                    Go and enjoy with Children!
                    They will love it and thank you for taking them!

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
